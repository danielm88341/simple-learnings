# Simple Learnings

This is meant to be a place where I can stash random lesson projects for items 
that catch my interest. These are generally not going to be original works and 
can be found around the internet. I will be making tweaks as I see fit however
(i.e. updating drivers / libraries to be a bit more modern on older demos).
